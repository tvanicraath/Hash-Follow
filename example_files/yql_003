I’ll be posting photos that I find compelling or I just happen to process at the moment. In the meantime if you do want to follow my trip with daily blog updates be sure to check out my <b><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sam-Antonio-Travel-and-Fine-Art-Photography/215997541014?ref=pymk\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Facebook</a></b> and <b><a href=\"http://twitter.com/samantoniophoto\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Twitter</a></b> pages.\n\nI’m currently in the beautiful country of Lao and in the southern region known as the 4000 Islands. I have a bungalow on the Mekong River (a whopping $6 U.S. dollars a day) and I spend all day in my hammock sleeping, listening to my iPod, reading and drinking Beerlao. Yes, life can be so hard.\n\nSo I have some time to write a quick blog post and surprisingly this place has a decent internet connection.\n\nAs I mentioned in a previous <b><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/samantonio/6940516193/in/photostream\"> blog</a></b> post, I have graduated from my backpacker days to being a flashpacker. After Thailand I headed to Lao and a popular way to get there is a two day slow boat cruise down the Mekong River. There are many options and the most common and cheapest way is to take the public boat.\n\nIf you like being crammed in a boat with 100 passengers that normally seats 70, sitting for hours on a hard wooden bench, sleeping on a floor and having to share one bathroom (or more like a hole in the rear of the boat) then by all means choose this option. I chose to go with a private boat. In total we had 13 people on our boat: 9 passengers and 4 crew members.\n\nWe cruised down the Mekong River in comfort.We had wonderful meals on board (on the public boat you have to bring your own food), plenty of room to stretch out and a real bathroom with a flushing toilet!\n\nThe best part is that we made a couple of stops to ethnic minority villages along the riverside. The moment our boat pulled up this girl started to work her sales magic on me. She never said one word to me. She didn’t have to since everything she had to communicate to me were in her eyes. \n\nCommunication without words...simply powerful.\n\nStay tuned for more of my adventures in Southeast Asia.\n\nHappy Travels! \n\n<i>Text and photo copyright by ©Sam Antonio Photography</i>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sam-Antonio-Travel-and-Fine-Art-Photography/215997541014?ref=pymk\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Why don't you join me on Facebook?</a></b>\n<b><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/109775789443112038938/posts\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Still figuring out Google +</a></b>\n<b><a href=\"http://twitter.com/samantoniophoto\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Follow me on Twitter!</a></b>\n<b><a href=\"http://samantoniophotography.blogspot.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Sam's Photography Blog</a></b>\n<b><a href=\"http://www.pbase.com/bircher\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Sam's Travel Photography Gallery</a></b>\n<b><a href=\"http://www.picturetrail.com/bircher\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Sam's Other Travel Photography Gallery</a></b>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","visibility":{"isfamily":"0","isfriend":"0","ispublic":"1"},"dates":{"lastupdate":"1338619893","posted":"1333384148","taken":"2012-03-07 11:43:08","takengranularity":"0"},"editability":{"canaddmeta":"0","cancomment":"0"},"publiceditability":{"canaddmeta":"0","cancomment":"1"},"usage":{"canblog":"0","candownload":"0","canprint":"0","canshare":"1"},"comments":"29","notes":{"note":{"author":"36385235@N08","authorname":"Sam Antonio Photography","h":"13","id":"72157629401020106","w":"15","x":"485","y":"0","content":"If you like this photo please give it a <b>fave!</b> Thanks!"}},"people":{"haspeople":"0"},"tags":{"tag":[{"author":"36385235@N08","id":"36292422-7020320651-86027259","machine_tag":"0","raw":"©SamAntonio.com","content":"©samantoniocom"},{"author":"36385235@N08","id":"36292422-7020320651-40482458","machine_tag":"0","raw":"Sam Antonio","content":"samantonio"},{"author":"36385235@N08","id":"36292422-7020320651-53886","machine_tag":"0","raw":"Lao","content":"lao"},{"author":"36385235@N08","id":"36292422-7020320651-311275","machine_tag":"0","raw":"Mekong River","content":"mekongriver"},{"author":"36385235@N08","id":"36292422-7020320651-219930","machine_tag":"0","raw":"Slow Boat","content":"slowboat"},{"author":"36385235@N08","id":"36292422-7020320651-32883","machine_tag":"0","raw":"Laos","content":"laos"},{"author":"36385235@N08","id":"36292422-7020320651-6868975","machine_tag":"0","raw":"Slow Boat to Luang Prabang","content":"slowboattoluangprabang"},{"author":"36385235@N08","id":"36292422-7020320651-867","machine_tag":"0","raw":"Girl","content":"girl"},{"author":"36385235@N08","id":"36292422-7020320651-1611","machine_tag":"0","raw":"Children","content":"children"},{"author":"36385235@N08","id":"36292422-7020320651-278","machine_tag":"0","raw":"Portrait","content":"portrait"},{"author":"36385235@N08","id":"36292422-7020320651-515664","machine_tag":"0","raw":"Travel Photography","content":"travelphotography"},{"author":"36385235@N08","id":"36292422-7020320651-3240","machine_tag":"0","raw":"Southeast Asia","content":"southeastasia"},{"author":"36385235@N08","id":"36292422-7020320651-1878290","machine_tag":"0","raw":"Travel Portrait","content":"travelportrait"},{"author":"36385235@N08","id":"36292422-7020320651-84487172","machine_tag":"0","raw":"Lao Ethnic Village","content":"laoethnicvillage"},{"author":"36385235@N08","id":"36292422-7020320651-2862","machine_tag":"0","raw":"Eyes","content":"eyes"},{"author":"36385235@N08","id":"36292422-7020320651-3840","machine_tag":"0","raw":"Child","content":"child"},{"author":"36385235@N08","id":"36292422-7020320651-13458888","machine_tag":"0","raw":"Mekong Slow Boat","content":"mekongslowboat"},{"author":"22871785@N02","id":"36292422-7020320651-16275184","machine_tag":"0","raw":"Earth Asia","content":"earthasia"},{"author":"36385235@N08","id":"36292422-7020320651-85670178","machine_tag":"0","raw":"Travelfish Laos","content":"travelfishlaos"}]},"location":{"accuracy":"2","context":"0","latitude":"18.205209","longitude":"105.451179","place_id":"hBWTl7JTUb6PrkFv3w","woeid":"23424872","country":{"place_id":"hBWTl7JTUb6PrkFv3w","woeid":"23424872","content":"Laos"}},"geoperms":{"iscontact":"0","isfamily":"0","isfriend":"0","ispublic":"1"},"urls":{"url":{"type":"photopage","content":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/samantonio/7020320651/"}}}}}});
