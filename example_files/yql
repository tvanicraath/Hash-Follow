It is home to family friendly beaches, the Hotel Del Coronado and to the North Island Naval Air Station. Coronado has more retired admirals than any other city in the country. \n\nAlthough most people call it an island, it is technically a peninsular, since it is connected to Imperial Beach. Originally named by Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo in 1542 as the &quot;crowned one,&quot; (Coronado is Spanish for &quot;crowned&quot;) Coronado wears her crown as Empress of San Diego bay. \n\nThe Hotel del Coronado is listed as a National Historic Landmark and has been the choice of 14 U.S. Presidents and numerous celebrities.\n\nThe &quot;Del,&quot; as it is commonly known to locals, is the largest wooden oceanside hotel on the West Coast.\n\nThere’s also a haunted side of the Del. Kate Morgan checked into the resort on November 25,1892 and never checked out. Reports of ghostly happenings have been circulating at The Del ever since, all thought to be connected to the death of this beautiful young woman. The ghost of Kate Morgan is said to be residing in Room 3312.\n\nHollywood has been making movies at The Del for more than a century (The first movie shot at the hotel was in 1901.) In 1958, The Del was the backdrop for the comedy classic, “Some Like it Hot,” starring Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. A scene from that movie was shot nearby where this photograph was taken.\n\nThe Del is spectacular to photograph anytime of the year, but in December the Del is adorned with Christmas lights and makes for a beautiful photograph to add to this special time of the year.\n\nMerry Christmas my Flickr friends!\n\nHappy Travels! \n\n<i>Text and photo copyright by ©Sam Antonio Photography</i>\n\n<b><a
