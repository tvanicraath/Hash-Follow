I did a quick little road trip to Arizona visiting the red rocks in Sedona, ringing in the new year in the mountain town of Flagstaff and taking in awe inspiring views at the Grand Canyon National Park.\n\nSunny days and mild, year-round weather make San Diego’s beaches a world class destination. Winter in San Diego is the best time to photograph landscapes due to clear skies (no haze or fog).\n\nImperial Beach or &quot;I.B.&quot; is the most southwesterly city in the continental United States. I took this photograph of the Imperial Beach Pier right after sunset while standing in the water. Well, in all truthfulness my camera and tripod were in the water and I ran like a little child back to dry sand after I clicked the shutter button to avoid getting wet. If you were standing on the pier you would get a clear view of the country of Mexico which is only a stone’s throw away (that is if you have an arm like quarterback Cam Newton). \n\nSo now that the sun has set on 2011, a new chapter in my life has open up for 2012.\n\nA little less than a month to go for my South East Asia trip. For some reason I haven’t done much research or planning for this trip. I learned after years of traveling that flexibility is far more important than research. \n\nFor my South East Asia Flickr contacts I would love to get together with you when I’m in your city for a photo shoot, to grab a cup of coffee or to just say hello. Please drop me a line.\n\nSo far my itinerary is shaping up to be flying into Singapore on February 3, 2012. After a couple of days I’ll head north to Kuala Lumpur and the rest of Malaysia. Then onto Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. Also on my radar will be the Philippines, Myanmar, Hong Kong and India.\n\nThank you to all my Flickr contacts for your friendship and support in 2011 and here’s to another successful year in 2012.\n\nHappy Travels! \n\n<i>Text and photo copyright by ©Sam Antonio Photography</i>\n\n<b><a
