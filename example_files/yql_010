One as a fine city to be living in while another means fines that keep the country in order.\n\nThis city is impeccable clean. It makes Main Street in Disneyland look like the Bronx in New York. How do they do it?  Singapore levies a multiple number of fines to maintain their squeaky, clean image.\n\nHere are punishable offenses in Singapore:\n\nThe sale of cigarettes to minors (under age 18)\nThe sale or possession of chewing of gum\nVandalism\nSpitting\nLittering\nUrinating in elevators\nFeeding the pigeons\nJaywalking\nPossession of firecrackers—caning\nEating or drinking in the subway\nNot flushing the toilet\nThe Possession or trafficking of &gt;20 grams of drugs—death\n\nNow before you cross off Singapore from your travel list keep this in mind, it is a city built for travelers: a clean and efficient public transportation, low crime, easy to navigate airport and diversity of food, culture and religions.\n\nMy visit was further enhanced when I met up with fellow Flickr member <b><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/charlie_kwan/\"> Charlie Kwan</a></b>. He was gracious enough to take me around his city and treat me to some great meals. Thank you for your hospitality Charlie.\n\nAs part of our photo walk around the city, we photographed around the Marina Bay Sands Resort. I crouched down low with my wide angle lens to capture this amazing foreground of the Artscience Museum with the Marina Bay Hotel Towers in the reflection.\n\nIf you have a chance to visit Singapore please do so...just remember to flush the toilet.\n\nStay tuned for more of my adventures in Southeast Asia.\n\nHappy Travels!
